Server based, IP Blacklisting Project. Automated server blacklist downloads to OS based firewalls seamlessly for free.

The IP Blacklist Database is free and works will all Linux and Windows operating systems by just creating simple OS scripted jobs. We blacklist IP addresses 
for known attempts of hacking, spamming, DDOS, Botnets, Scrapers and more.

IP Blacklist is fully automated and scans in real time any of our honeypot servers for attacks and logs the IP address to our central databases. The ip blacklist 
is published on this site and updates every 30 minutes for anyone to download. These IP addresses are published on our blacklist page. IP Blacklist can also be 
fully automated on any server from our blacklist by using native unix commands such as ipset and iptables.
